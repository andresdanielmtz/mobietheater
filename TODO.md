# To-do List

- Fix bug regarding URL and profileID
  - It only opens the profile URL if the user has either changed their username or bio, since it creates an entry within user/ route.
  - It should be fixed either by creating an entry in Firestore for user/, so it would store its user's information.
- Light mode debugging
